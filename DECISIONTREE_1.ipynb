    "           The decision tree classifier algorithm recursively selects the best feature to split the dataset, creating a tree-like structure where each node represents a feature and each leaf node represents a class label. It predicts the class label of new instances by traversing the tree based on their feature values.\n",

    "#### Feature Selection: \n",
    "The algorithm starts by selecting the best feature to split the dataset. It evaluates different features using various metrics such as Gini impurity, entropy, or information gain to determine which feature provides the best split.\n",

    "#### Splitting: \n",
    "Once the best feature is selected, the dataset is split into subsets based on the values of that feature. Each subset represents a different branch of the decision tree.\n",

    "#### Recursion:\n",
    "The splitting process is applied recursively on each subset obtained from the previous step. This process continues until one of the stopping criteria is met, such as reaching a maximum tree depth, having all instances in a node belong to the same class, or having a minimum number of instances in a node.\n",

    "Decision trees are prone to overfitting, especially when the tree grows too large. Pruning techniques can be applied to trim the tree by removing unnecessary branches or nodes, thus improving generalization and reducing overfitting.\n",

    "#### Prediction: \n",
    "To make predictions for new instances, the algorithm traverses the decision tree starting from the root node, following the splits based on the values of the features until it reaches a leaf node. The class label assigned to that leaf node is then assigned to the new instance."
